PGGI is a php extension providing a small langage binding for GTK+ 3 toolkit.

I made this extension in purpose to learn how to make php extension and learn GTK, therefore this extension is highly experimental but if you want try it, I would love receiving feedbacks.

For now there isn't much but I intend to add more to it.
